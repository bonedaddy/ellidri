# kawaii

This repository contains some crates that may be helpful to the IRC smith of the
21st century!  They were built around ellidri, a modern [IRC server][ircd] (or
IRCd, for short).  You will especially find:

- an IRC parsing library, ellidri-tokens, which provides tools to correctly and
  efficiently parse IRC messages and mode strings,
- ellidri-unicase, providing a wrapper around strings to make them
  case-insensitive regarding IRC's different case mappings,
- an IRC server, ellidri, that aims to be simple to setup, feature complete and
  scalable.

To discuss about ellidri and cie, join the IRC channel: #ellidri on
ellidri.org (port 6697 with TLS)!

The rest of this document is about ellidri, the IRC server.  All other projects
have their own `README.md`.

## Features

- IRCv3 server
- Configurable via a file that can be reloaded at runtime
- kawaii messages

[Supported extensions][ext]: `account-notify`, `away-notify`, `batch`,
`cap-notify`, `echo-message`, `extended-join`, `invite-notify`,
`labeled-response`, `message-ids`, `message-tags`, `multi-prefix`,
`server-time`, `setname`, `userhost-in-names`

ellidri doesn't support any server-to-server (S2S) protocol.  As such, it is
impossible to make several instances of ellidri manage the same IRC network.

ellidri requires UTF-8 from clients, and for now it only supports `ascii` as
casemapping.

## Build and install

Prerequisites:

- The Rust compiler and Cargo: <https://rustup.rs/>

Install ellidri with `cargo install ellidri`, or with the [AUR package][aur].

During development, build it with `cargo build`, and run it with `cargo run`.

For packaging, build it with `cargo build --release --locked`.  The `release`
flag will enable optimizations and the `locked` flag will require a valid lock
file (`Cargo.lock`), to make sure that the same dependencies are used for
development and for release.  The executable is generated at
`target/release/ellidri`.
